Java Thoughtd Rpc Client
========================

Thought4j is a lightweight Java thought JSON-RPC client binding. It does not require any external dependencies.

It is based on the Bitcoin RPC Java library found here: https://github.com/Polve/JavaBitcoindRpcClient, which itself is simply a repackaging of the original tool described here https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin-JSON-RPC-Client with some small improvements.

### Building ###

Building thought4j requires Java 8 (or higher) Development Kit and Maven.

Clone the thought4j repository, then install using Maven:  

```
git clone https://github.com/thoughtnetwork/thought4j.git
cd thought4j
mvn install
```
